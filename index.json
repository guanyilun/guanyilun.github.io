[{"content":"After spending several hours reading jax\u0026rsquo;s documentation1 I have finally grasped the basic idea of it. I will try to summarize it in words. It is built upon an elegant concept which I call function reinterpretation. The idea is that, given an unknown implementation of a function, one can define a transformation that reinterprets the implementation of the function without knowing its details as long as the underlying function is composable of a well-defined set of primitive functions that we have provided. It sounds like magic, but it is indeed feasible and lies at the heart of jax.\njax implements this by passing in a special object known as the Tracer to the function to obtain a specific functional Trace of our target. Intuitively, this is like attaching a mini camera to our input variable so it can observe the system and trace out its inner workings.\nTo achieve this, first we need to design our primitives such that their evaluation can be intercepted and routed to our target Trace object which encapsulates the specific function reinterpretation that we want to do. We then define a corresponding Tracer object that can be used to perform (or realize) the Trace transformation. Tracer also carries important data relevant to the specific tracing analysis. When we pass these tracers into the function we are probing, our tracers will trigger a series of primitive function calls which are then routed to our Trace object, which defines how to reinterpret each specific primitive function in terms of custom operations on the \u0026ldquo;payload\u0026rdquo; of our Tracer. To give a specific example, suppose our function contains an addition of two variables, such as\ndef target(a, b): c = a + b d = c + a return d and that we want to map all additions inside our target function to multiplications, we can define two Tracer objects that carry payload of a, b, respectively. When our Trace intercepts the calls from \u0026ldquo;addition\u0026rdquo; primitives, it then takes the two tracer arguments, multiplies their payload and promotes it to another Tracer object with a payload of a*b to proceed to the subsequent computations. At the end of the function call, we will get a tracer object as the return. We can then simply read off its payload which represents the result of an reinterpretation of our target function that turns addition into multiplication. If we redefine the entire process as a new function, such as the following pseudocode,\ndef add2mul(func): def f(a, b): return func(Tracer(payload=a), Tracer(payload=b)).payload return f transformed_target = add2mul(target) We have effectively transformed our target function into a different function by modifying its inner computation without actually knowing its implementation details!\nhttps://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodidax.html\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://guanyilun.github.io/posts/jax/","summary":"After spending several hours reading jax\u0026rsquo;s documentation1 I have finally grasped the basic idea of it.
